Housing Price Prediction
This project demonstrates the use of simple and multiple linear regression models to predict housing prices using a dataset that includes features such as area, location, and amenities.

Simple Linear Regression:
Trains a model using only the area feature to predict housing prices.
Evaluates model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.
Visualizes the relationship between area and price with actual vs. predicted values.

Multiple Linear Regression:
Uses all available features to train a more comprehensive regression model.
Evaluates performance with standard metrics and compares actual vs. predicted prices.
Displays the influence (coefficients) of each feature on the predicted price.

Visualizations
A scatter plot with a regression line for simple linear regression.
A scatter plot comparing actual and predicted prices for multiple linear regression.
